-- Kill_IF:
-- gives the command to kill the instruction that has been read in Fetch.
-- Must be activated each time it is jumped (jump_taken entry), since by default the instruction following the jump has been fetched and if it is jumped it does not have to be executed.
-- IMPORTANT: 
-- jal, ret and rte are unconditional jumps: IF is always invalidated.
-- beq is conditional: IF is invalidated only when the branch is taken and there is no data hazard in ID.
-- if the instruction in ID is not valid, you have to ignore it when it tells you that it is going to jump (the same as if it tells you anything else), but pay attention to the valid instructions.

-- stall_MIPS: used to stop the entire processor when the memory cannot perform the requested operation in the current cycle (i.e. when IO_MEM_ready is 0). 
-- Why do we stop the whole processor and not just the memory stage and the previous ones? 
		-- The reason is that if they are not stopped, data that was going to be anticipated may be lost. In the following example you see:
		-- ADD R1, R2, R3 F D E M W
		-- LW R8, 0(R7) 	F D E M M M M W
		-- ADD R6, R1, R4 	  F D E E E E M W
		-- ADD R6 cannot read R1 in ID, but does not stop because it can anticipate it. However, LW R8 stops its execution several cycles because the memory is not ready.
		-- If we allow ADD R1 to continue, the data we wanted to anticipate disappears, and when ADD R6 goes to read it, it will not be there. 
		-- The solution is to stop ADD R1 as well:
		-- ADD R1, R2, R3 F  D  E  M  W  W  W  W  W    
		-- LW R8, 0(R7) 	 F  D  E  M  M  M  M  M  W
		-- ADD R6, R1, R4 	    F  D  E  E  E  E  E  M  W
		-- In this way ADD R6 can perform its anticipation. Writing the same data several times does not consume energy, so there is no real penalty either. However, if you don't want to write the same data multiple times to BR, you can disable writing to the register bank when the mips is stopped.
-- stall_MIPS_internal is defined to be readable in the code (in vhdl the outputs of an entity cannot be read inside the entity.
