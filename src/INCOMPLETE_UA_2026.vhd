-- Incomplete design. We give you this as an example. You must complete it yourselves
-- We activate the signal Corto_A_Mem, when we detect that the operand stored in A (Rs) is the same as the one written by the instruction in the Mem stage.
-- Important: we only activate the forwarding if the instruction in the MEM stage is valid.
-- IMPORTANT: the JAL instruction is somewhat special because the data it writes to BR is different from the rest.
-- Is it possible to use the forwarding network in the JAL-distance use cases 1 and 2? Is there any case that does not -- Can it happen in this processor -- What solution do you propose?
-- Example: Jal r1, @jump; @jump: ADD R1, R2, R1;
